1. Clone the repo
2. Open every subproject separately
3. Configure:

- Backend:
    Configure the port the spring application should run on

- Raspi Controller:
    Open the class 'RequestSender' and change the IP and Port to the backend's one

- Frontend:
    Configure properties with the backend's IP and Port
    
    
Enjoy :)
