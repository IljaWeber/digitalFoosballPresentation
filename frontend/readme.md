#Introduction
This web application is written in JavaScript using the React Framework. 

##Installation 

To use React applications you need to install nodejs

1. For Unix based systems run: 
`sudo apt update` and then `sudo apt install nodejs`
Further you need to install the package management system npm with:
`sudo apt install npm`

2. For Windows: 
Visit the official [nodejs website](https:///nodejs.org/en/download/) 
Pick a fitting version and follow the installation instructions.

Verify the installation of nodejs and npm with: `node -v` and `npm -v`

##How to use
By `npm start run` in frontend module it will start the react application on localhost port:3000.
Usually a new tab opens in your browser and displays the current developing progress of the React application. 

#####Unlike the Spring application in the backend module this React application will start independently from Spring.
